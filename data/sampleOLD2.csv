FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS



What is ADAS?

		 The Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) uses image processing   cameras, radar, light detection and ranging and other sensors to monitor   vehicle surroundings and detect potentially dangerous situations.   Purpose: to increase safety through advanced situational awareness and   reduce collision possibilities.
	

		 Sensors used in ADAS include cameras, radars, lasers and ultrasound.   They can detect light, heat, pressure and other variables used to   monitor the state of vehicle. Usually they locate in the front and rear   bumpers, side mirrors, vehicle cab and wind shield glasses.
	




What are the applications of ADAS?

		 ADAS usually includes Traffic Message Channel (TMC), Intelligent Speed   Adaptation (ISA), Vehicular Communication Systems and other driver   assistant systems. The specific systems are as follows:
	

 Vehicle Cab: 


		 1) Lane Departure Warning System
	

		 2) Lane Keeping Assist
	

		 3) Traffic Sign/Signal Recognition
	

		 4) Night Vision System
	

		 5) Driver Status Monitor
	

		 6) Electric Vehicle Warning
	

		 7) Hill Descent Control
	

 Front: 


		 1) Parking Assist
	

		 2) Adaptive Front/Lighting System
	

		 3) Adaptive Cruise Control
	

		 4) Pedestrian Detection
	

		 5) Emergency Brake
	

 Rear: 


		 1) Reverse Image
	

		 2) Parking Assist
	

		 3) Rear Collision Warning
	

 Side: 


		 1) Surround View
	

		 2) Blind Spot Detection
	




When to use ADAS?

		 Under normal circumstances, after repair in an accident, calibration   of the relevant auxiliary systems need to be performed. When   disassembling or reinstalling monitoring components such as cameras,   radars, and sensors, replacing the vehicle ECU, or the vehicle height   has been changed, auxiliary and other systems need to be calibrated.
	

		 For example: ACC calibration needs to be performed in the following cases.
	

		 1. Repair or replace the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) radar sensor control unit
	

		 2. ACC radar sensor deviation angle out of normal range
	

		 3. Adjust position of the ACC radar sensor on the vehicle body
	

		 4. Repair or replace bumper or radiator grill
	

		 5. Adjust chassis
	




How to use MaxiSys ADAS?

		 Perform the following steps prior to setting-up calibration toolset.
	

		 ? Park the vehicle on a flat and level surface with its front wheels pointing straight and ensure there are no objects
	

		 in front of the vehicle.
	

		 ? The vehicles coolants and engine oil should be at recommended levels and the gas tank full. The vehicle should
	

		 not be carrying any load (passengers or cargo).
	

		 ? Attach the VCI to the vehicle and connect the diagnostic tool to the vehicle (if connected through cable, please
	

		 pass cable through window).
	

		 ? Close the vehicle doors.
	

		 ? Adjust the tire pressure to the recommended value.
	

		 ? The preparation measures vary by vehicle and system. Please follow the instructions on the MaxiSys ADAS
	

		 tablet to ensure accurate calibration.
	




What is ADAS Front-view Camera?

		 The front-view camera captures what is in front of the vehicle. It is   used in a number of ADAS systems, including Lane Departure Warning   (LDW), Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) and Traffic Sign/Signal Recognition   (TSR) systems, often in conjunction with other sensors, cameras or   sensing systems to provide input data.
	




What is ADAS 360°Camera?

		 The 360° or Surround View Camera System uses multiple camera views to   create one 360° top-down (birds eye) view surrounding the vehicle.   This system is used in both passive (displayed instructions) and active   (autonomous) vehicle parking assist systems.
	




What is ADAS Radar Sensor?

		 ADAS radar sensors detect fixed and moving objects at different   distances around the perimeter of a vehicle. Different Radar types and   frequencies are used in various ADAS systems. Ultra short-range radar   (USRR) and short-range radar (SRR) provide data for blind-spot detection   (BSD) and lane-change assist (LCA), while systems including adaptive   cruise control (ACC) use longer range radar.
	




How can I get the ADAS software?

		 To get the valuable ADAS calibration software, you can purchase the   MaxiSys ADAS tablet or purchase the ADAS calibration software upgrade   for your existing MaxiSys tablet.
	




What are the technology tools of ADAS and where are they in my vehicle?

		 Cameras, sensors, ultrasound, radar and LIDAR are some of the systems   used to capture the driving environment data, including travelling or   static vehicles position, pedestrian location, road sign, driving lane   and intersection detection, road (curves) and driving conditions (poor   visibility or evening driving), use that information to instruct the   vehicle to take its predetermined action. Cameras, sensors and sensing   systems are typically location in front and rear bumpers, windshield,   front grill and side and rear view mirrors.
	




What if my car is not in a horizontal position?

		 ADAS calibration procedures should be performed on a level floor. If   an alignment lift is used for leveling, the Autel calibration software   can provide adjustment information and the calibration frame can be   easily raised or lowered to be level with the vehicle.
	




Which areas does Autel MaxiSys ADAS support?

		 The MaxiSys ADAS currently supports calibrations for most todays ADAS-enabled vehicles in the USA, Asian, European markets.
	




What are the requirements for the calibration shop?

		 1.Perform calibration procedures indoors without object obstructions
	

		 2.No exterior light sources to cast uneven surface shadows
	

		 3.Some procedures require bright background light alignments
	




What are the requirements for the calibration surface?

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS



What is ADAS?

		 The Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) uses image processing   cameras, radar, light detection and ranging and other sensors to monitor   vehicle surroundings and detect potentially dangerous situations.   Purpose: to increase safety through advanced situational awareness and   reduce collision possibilities.
	

		 Sensors used in ADAS include cameras, radars, lasers and ultrasound.   They can detect light, heat, pressure and other variables used to   monitor the state of vehicle. Usually they locate in the front and rear   bumpers, side mirrors, vehicle cab and wind shield glasses.
	




What are the applications of ADAS?

		 ADAS usually includes Traffic Message Channel (TMC), Intelligent Speed   Adaptation (ISA), Vehicular Communication Systems and other driver   assistant systems. The specific systems are as follows:
	

 Vehicle Cab: 


		 1) Lane Departure Warning System

 Side: 


		 1) Surround View
	

		 2) Blind Spot Detection
	




When to use ADAS?

		 Under normal circumstances, after repair in an accident, calibration   of the relevant auxiliary systems need to be performed. When   disassembling or reinstalling monitoring components such as cameras,   radars, and sensors, replacing the vehicle ECU, or the vehicle height   has been changed, auxiliary and other systems need to be calibrated.
	

		 For example: ACC calibration needs to be performed in the following cases.
	

		 1. Repair or replace the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) radar sensor control unit
	

		 2. ACC radar sensor deviation angle out of normal range
	

		 3. Adjust position of the ACC radar sensor on the vehicle body
	

		 4. Repair or replace bumper or radiator grill
	

		 5. Adjust chassis
	




How to use MaxiSys ADAS?

		 Perform the following steps prior to setting-up calibration toolset.
	

		 ? Park the vehicle on a flat and level surface with its front wheels pointing straight and ensure there are no objects
	

		 in front of the vehicle.
	

		 ? The vehicles coolants and engine oil should be at recommended levels and the gas tank full. The vehicle should
	

		 not be carrying any load (passengers or cargo).
	

		 ? Attach the VCI to the vehicle and connect the diagnostic tool to the vehicle (if connected through cable, please
	

		 pass cable through window).
	

		 ? Close the vehicle doors.
	

		 ? Adjust the tire pressure to the recommended value.
	

		 ? The preparation measures vary by vehicle and system. Please follow the instructions on the MaxiSys ADAS
	

		 tablet to ensure accurate calibration.
	




What is ADAS Front-view Camera?

		 The front-view camera captures what is in front of the vehicle. It is   used in a number of ADAS systems, including Lane Departure Warning   (LDW), Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) and Traffic Sign/Signal Recognition   (TSR) systems, often in conjunction with other sensors, cameras or   sensing systems to provide input data.
	




What is ADAS 360°Camera?

		 The 360° or Surround View Camera System uses multiple camera views to   create one 360° top-down (birds eye) view surrounding the vehicle.   This system is used in both passive (displayed instructions) and active   (autonomous) vehicle parking assist systems.
	




What is ADAS Radar Sensor?

		 ADAS radar sensors detect fixed and moving objects at different   distances around the perimeter of a vehicle. Different Radar types and   frequencies are used in various ADAS systems. Ultra short-range radar   (USRR) and short-range radar (SRR) provide data for blind-spot detection   (BSD) and lane-change assist (LCA), while systems including adaptive   cruise control (ACC) use longer range radar.
	




How can I get the ADAS software?

		 To get the valuable ADAS calibration software, you can purchase the   MaxiSys ADAS tablet or purchase the ADAS calibration software upgrade   for your existing MaxiSys tablet.
	




What are the technology tools of ADAS and where are they in my vehicle?

		 Cameras, sensors, ultrasound, radar and LIDAR are some of the systems   used to capture the driving environment data, including travelling or   static vehicles position, pedestrian location, road sign, driving lane   and intersection detection, road (curves) and driving conditions (poor   visibility or evening driving), use that information to instruct the   vehicle to take its predetermined action. Cameras, sensors and sensing   systems are typically location in front and rear bumpers, windshield,   front grill and side and rear view mirrors.
	




What if my car is not in a horizontal position?

		 ADAS calibration procedures should be performed on a level floor. If   an alignment lift is used for leveling, the Autel calibration software   can provide adjustment information and the calibration frame can be   easily raised or lowered to be level with the vehicle.
	




Which areas does Autel MaxiSys ADAS support?

		 The MaxiSys ADAS currently supports calibrations for most todays ADAS-enabled vehicles in the USA, Asian, European markets.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS



What is ADAS?

		 The Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) uses image processing   cameras, radar, light detection and ranging and other sensors to monitor   vehicle surroundings and detect potentially dangerous situations.   Purpose: to increase safety through advanced situational awareness and   reduce collision possibilities.
	

		 Sensors used in ADAS include cameras, radars, lasers and ultrasound.   They can detect light, heat, pressure and other variables used to   monitor the state of vehicle. Usually they locate in the front and rear   bumpers, side mirrors, vehicle cab and wind shield glasses.
	




What are the applications of ADAS?

		 ADAS usually includes Traffic Message Channel (TMC), Intelligent Speed   Adaptation (ISA), Vehicular Communication Systems and other driver   assistant systems. The specific systems are as follows:
	

 Vehicle Cab: 


		 1) Lane Departure Warning System

 Side: 


		 1) Surround View
	

		 2) Blind Spot Detection
	




When to use ADAS?

		 Under normal circumstances, after repair in an accident, calibration   of the relevant auxiliary systems need to be performed. When   disassembling or reinstalling monitoring components such as cameras,   radars, and sensors, replacing the vehicle ECU, or the vehicle height   has been changed, auxiliary and other systems need to be calibrated.
	

		 For example: ACC calibration needs to be performed in the following cases.
	

		 1. Repair or replace the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) radar sensor control unit
	

		 2. ACC radar sensor deviation angle out of normal range
	

		 3. Adjust position of the ACC radar sensor on the vehicle body
	

		 4. Repair or replace bumper or radiator grill
	

		 5. Adjust chassis
	




How to use MaxiSys ADAS?

		 Perform the following steps prior to setting-up calibration toolset.
	

		 ? Park the vehicle on a flat and level surface with its front wheels pointing straight and ensure there are no objects
	

		 in front of the vehicle.
	

		 ? The vehicles coolants and engine oil should be at recommended levels and the gas tank full. The vehicle should
	

		 not be carrying any load (passengers or cargo).
	

		 ? Attach the VCI to the vehicle and connect the diagnostic tool to the vehicle (if connected through cable, please
	

		 pass cable through window).
	

		 ? Close the vehicle doors.
	

		 ? Adjust the tire pressure to the recommended value.
	

		 ? The preparation measures vary by vehicle and system. Please follow the instructions on the MaxiSys ADAS
	

		 tablet to ensure accurate calibration.
	




What is ADAS Front-view Camera?

		 The front-view camera captures what is in front of the vehicle. It is   used in a number of ADAS systems, including Lane Departure Warning   (LDW), Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) and Traffic Sign/Signal Recognition   (TSR) systems, often in conjunction with other sensors, cameras or   sensing systems to provide input data.
	




What is ADAS 360°Camera?

		 The 360° or Surround View Camera System uses multiple camera views to   create one 360° top-down (birds eye) view surrounding the vehicle.   This system is used in both passive (displayed instructions) and active   (autonomous) vehicle parking assist systems.
	




What is ADAS Radar Sensor?

		 ADAS radar sensors detect fixed and moving objects at different   distances around the perimeter of a vehicle. Different Radar types and   frequencies are used in various ADAS systems. Ultra short-range radar   (USRR) and short-range radar (SRR) provide data for blind-spot detection   (BSD) and lane-change assist (LCA), while systems including adaptive   cruise control (ACC) use longer range radar.
	




How can I get the ADAS software?

		 To get the valuable ADAS calibration software, you can purchase the   MaxiSys ADAS tablet or purchase the ADAS calibration software upgrade   for your existing MaxiSys tablet.
	




What are the technology tools of ADAS and where are they in my vehicle?

		 Cameras, sensors, ultrasound, radar and LIDAR are some of the systems   used to capture the driving environment data, including travelling or   static vehicles position, pedestrian location, road sign, driving lane   and intersection detection, road (curves) and driving conditions (poor   visibility or evening driving), use that information to instruct the   vehicle to take its predetermined action. Cameras, sensors and sensing   systems are typically location in front and rear bumpers, windshield,   front grill and side and rear view mirrors.
	




What if my car is not in a horizontal position?

		 ADAS calibration procedures should be performed on a level floor. If   an alignment lift is used for leveling, the Autel calibration software   can provide adjustment information and the calibration frame can be   easily raised or lowered to be level with the vehicle.
	




Which areas does Autel MaxiSys ADAS support?

How do I know if the ADAS recalibration was successful?

		 The technician can review the post-calibration scan to confirm if the   module DTC is cleared. The ADAS module calibration will not complete if   the calibration steps were not followed correctly.
	




What are the different types of ADAS calibrations and are they brand specific?

		 Depending on vehicle type, either a Stationary or Dynamic calibration   procedure is required (in some vehicle types both are required) to   calibrate ADAS sensors to vehicle modules.
	

		  Stationary calibrations are completed in a shop environment and requires the use of targets or patterns to complete.
	

		  Dynamic calibrations require the vehicle to be driven on roadways   for a certain amount of time with well maintained road markings.
	




What are the shop environment requirements for calibration procedures?

		  Flat and level surface with enough room around the vehicle to   complete calibration procedures. (generally, there should not be objects   within the 15 foot by 30 foot calibration area)
	

		  Perform calibration procedures indoors without object obstructions.
	

		  No exterior light sources to cast uneven surface shadows.
	

		  Some procedures require bright background light alignments.
	




What vehicle preparation is required before performing calibration procedures?

		  The vehicle coolants and engine oil should be at recommended levels and the gas tank full.
	

		  The vehicle should not be carrying any load (passengers or cargo).
	

		  Adjust the tire pressure to the recommended value.
	

		  Attach the wireless VCI to the vehicle DLC.

		 1) Surround View
	

		 2) Blind Spot Detection
	




When to use ADAS?

		 Under normal circumstances, after repair in an accident, calibration   of the relevant auxiliary systems need to be performed. When   disassembling or reinstalling monitoring components such as cameras,   radars, and sensors, replacing the vehicle ECU, or the vehicle height   has been changed, auxiliary and other systems need to be calibrated.
	

		 For example: ACC calibration needs to be performed in the following cases.
	

		 1. Repair or replace the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) radar sensor control unit
	

		 2. ACC radar sensor deviation angle out of normal range
	

		 3. Adjust position of the ACC radar sensor on the vehicle body
	

		 4. Repair or replace bumper or radiator grill
	

		 5. Adjust chassis
	




How to use MaxiSys ADAS?

		 Perform the following steps prior to setting-up calibration toolset.
	

		 ? Park the vehicle on a flat and level surface with its front wheels pointing straight and ensure there are no objects
	

		 in front of the vehicle.
	

		 ? The vehicles coolants and engine oil should be at recommended levels and the gas tank full. The vehicle should
	

		 not be carrying any load (passengers or cargo).
	

		 ? Attach the VCI to the vehicle and connect the diagnostic tool to the vehicle (if connected through cable, please
	

		 pass cable through window).
	

		 ? Close the vehicle doors.
	

		 ? Adjust the tire pressure to the recommended value.
	

		 ? The preparation measures vary by vehicle and system. Please follow the instructions on the MaxiSys ADAS
	

		 tablet to ensure accurate calibration.
	




What is ADAS Front-view Camera?

		 The front-view camera captures what is in front of the vehicle. It is   used in a number of ADAS systems, including Lane Departure Warning   (LDW), Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) and Traffic Sign/Signal Recognition   (TSR) systems, often in conjunction with other sensors, cameras or   sensing systems to provide input data.
	




What is ADAS 360°Camera?

		 The 360° or Surround View Camera System uses multiple camera views to   create one 360° top-down (birds eye) view surrounding the vehicle.   This system is used in both passive (displayed instructions) and active   (autonomous) vehicle parking assist systems.
	




What is ADAS Radar Sensor?

		 ADAS radar sensors detect fixed and moving objects at different   distances around the perimeter of a vehicle. Different Radar types and   frequencies are used in various ADAS systems. Ultra short-range radar   (USRR) and short-range radar (SRR) provide data for blind-spot detection   (BSD) and lane-change assist (LCA), while systems including adaptive   cruise control (ACC) use longer range radar.
	




How can I get the ADAS software?

		 To get the valuable ADAS calibration software, you can purchase the   MaxiSys ADAS tablet or purchase the ADAS calibration software upgrade   for your existing MaxiSys tablet.
	




What are the technology tools of ADAS and where are they in my vehicle?

		 Cameras, sensors, ultrasound, radar and LIDAR are some of the systems   used to capture the driving environment data, including travelling or   static vehicles position, pedestrian location, road sign, driving lane   and intersection detection, road (curves) and driving conditions (poor   visibility or evening driving), use that information to instruct the   vehicle to take its predetermined action. Cameras, sensors and sensing   systems are typically location in front and rear bumpers, windshield,   front grill and side and rear view mirrors.
	




What if my car is not in a horizontal position?

		 ADAS calibration procedures should be performed on a level floor. If   an alignment lift is used for leveling, the Autel calibration software   can provide adjustment information and the calibration frame can be   easily raised or lowered to be level with the vehicle.

		 a. Yes, you can add multiple ADAS capable tablets to your calibration   frame. However, only one type of calibration frame can be activated on   each tablet. Be sure to select the correct calibration frame as this   selection cannot be un-done and two version of the ADAS software cannot   reside on the same tablet.
	




Can I purchase just the ADASUPGRADE without the calibration frame to perform ADAS calibration procedures?

		 a. Yes, however, a large portion of vehicles require static   calibrations, where special equipment is placed around the vehicles at   specified locations. Remember, the tool will ask which type of   calibration frame you are using when you add the ADAS software. If you   dont have a calibration frame yet, select the option you would most   likely get.
	




What are the different types of ADAS calibration and are they brand specific?

		 a. There are two types of ADAS calibration, STATIC and DYNAMIC. The   type of calibration required is determined by the vehicle manufacturer.
	

STATIC CALIBRATIONS are performed in the service bay using  vehicle specific targets and patterns. Static calibrations  require controlled conditions, such as bright even lighting,  flat level floor, no clutter behind the targets, etc.
DYNAMIC CALIBRATIONS are performed while driving the  vehicle under very specific conditions determined by the  vehicle manufacturer. These conditions include, calibrating  during the day, clearly visible lane markings, clear weather  conditions, specific driving speeds,flat roads with minimal  hills or curves, minimal traffic, etc.





Which vehicle actions require ADAS system dianostics or ADAS sensor calibration?

		 a. ADAS sensor or camera replacement, collision repair, four wheel   alignment, changes in ride height (within vehicle manufacturers   specifications), windshield replacement, certain mechanical repairs   which require the removal of bumper covers, grill, etc., ADAS related   diagnostic service, ADAS sensor or camera removed and reinstalled or   changes in tire size (within vehicle manufacturers specifications).
	




What is the easiest way to check the vehicle to confirm which ADAS module are active?

		 a. Performing a Pre-Scan with your Autel MaxiSYS will provide a list   of all modules currently communication of the vehicle data network. An   ADAS icon will display next to a module with ADAS functionality.
	




Does the calibration frame require assembly?

		 a. Yes, frame assembly is a simple 20-25 minute process. Illustrated   instructions, hardware and required wrenches are included. We also have   an assembly video on the www.maxisysadas.com website.
	




How do I know what patterns and calibration procedures to use?

		 a. The Autel MaxiSYS ADAS software displays vehicle specific   illustrated step-by-step calibration instructions, which include a list   of all needed targets, patterns and accessories required to complete the   calibration.
	




What vehicle preparation is required before performing calibration procedures?

		 a. The Autel MaxiSYS ADAS software will provide a detailed list of   vehicle manufacturer specific calibration preparation instructions. The   preparation requirement vary by vehicle make. Some common calibration   requirements include:
	

Vehicle must be parked on flat, level surface
 All fluids must be filled to the recommended levels, e.g. oil, coolant, etc.
The fuel tank must be full
Tire pressure must be set to placard level
No passengers or additional load in the vehicle
All doors and hood must be closed
Connect an auxiliary battery power supply





How do I know if the ADAS recalibration was successful?

		 a. At the end of the calibration procedure the Autel MaxiSYS will   display a screen indicating the calibration completed successfully. It   is a good idea to perform a screenshot at this point and attach this   screen to your post scan report. On some vehicle makes calibration   parameters will be added to the post-SCAN report which indicate the   accuracy of the calibration.

Launch Tech USA X-431 ADAS










DESCRIPTION

			ADAS stand for Advanced Driver Assist   Systems- These systems are designed to create a safer environment for   the driver and those around him. These systems help reduce the   possibility of an accident or collision. They have been around since the   late 1990s but used in the early to mid 2000s in the US with the use   of Adaptive Cruise Control or ACC. These vehicles made use of LiDAR   distance detection but only offered a warning to the driver. Those   systems would be classified as a passive system. Todays systems are more   advanced and integrated. They use multiple sensor inputs such as   cameras and radar to assist and warn the driver of surrounding danger.
		




PRODUCT FEATURES

The modular structure and useful accessories enable you to configure the tool in the best way to suit your workshop.
Easily and precisely adjust calibration frame to ensure vehicle is correctly centered.
Can be used even without an axial measuring system.
Multiple calibration function, wide car model coverage.
All kinds of vehicle-specific calibration panels are available.
Provide the instruction before beginning a calibration procedure.





X-431 ADAS Product Components









TYPES OF CALIBRATIONS
Dynamic vs static calibration- There are two types of recalibration that are performed for ADAS. 

Static calibration  is a   calibration that is performed in a controlled environment (Indoor shop   with good lighting, level ground, and required space) with special   targets placed in specific locations in front and around the vehicle.   Also a scanner is required to communicate with the modules of that   vehicle.
		









Dynamic calibration  also referred to   as mobile calibration, is performed by driving your car for a   prescribed distance, at a prescribed speed and in optimum weather   conditions. A handheld device (scanner) that aids the process is   attached to the car during the test. The purpose of this type of   calibration is for the systems to get accustomed to the road so that   they can be ready for all the functions theyre expected to perform.

CREATE CHANGE

					The increase in complexity has brought   about a challenge in the auto industry. You can no longer perform basic   procedures or replace components and not worry about it affecting these   driver assist systems. And if you happen to unplug or replace a   component that is attached to these systems you will find that it will   require a recalibration to clear a warning or check engine light. You   cant just clear the code. Here is a list of the most common procedure   that require a recalibration:
				

Windshield Replacement
Alignment
Front and rear bumper replacement
Side view mirrors
Rear trunk or tailgate
Front or rear collision

		      The 360° or Surround   View Camera System uses multiple camera views to create one 360°   top-down (birds eye) view surrounding the vehicle. This system is used   in both passive (displayed instructions) and active (autonomous) vehicle   parking assist systems.
	




What is ADAS Radar Sensor？

		      ADAS radar sensors   detect fixed and moving objects at different distances around the   perimeter of a vehicle. Different Radar types and frequencies are used   in various ADAS systems. Ultra short-range radar (USRR) and short-range   radar (SRR) provide data for blind-spot detection (BSD) and lane-change   assist (LCA), while systems including adaptive cruise control (ACC) use   longer range radar.
	




How can I get the ADAS software?

		To get the valuable ADAS   calibration software, you can purchase the MaxiSys ADAS tablet or   purchase the ADAS calibration software upgrade for your existing MaxiSys   tablet.
	




What are the technology tools of ADAS and where are they in my vehicle?

		      Cameras, sensors, ultrasound, radar and LIDAR are   some of the systems used to capture the driving environment data,   including travelling or static vehicles position, pedestrian location,   road sign, driving lane and intersection detection, road (curves) and   driving conditions (poor visibility or evening driving), use that   information to instruct the vehicle to take its predetermined action.   Cameras, sensors and sensing systems are typically location in front and   rear bumpers, windshield, front grill and side and rear view mirrors.
	




What if my car is not in a horizontal position?

		ADAS calibration procedures   should be performed on a level floor. If an alignment lift is used for   leveling, the Autel calibration software can provide adjustment   information and the calibration frame can be easily raised or lowered to   be level with the vehicle.
	





Which areas does Autel MaxiSys ADAS support?

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS



What is ADAS?

		 The Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) uses image processing   cameras, radar, light detection and ranging and other sensors to monitor   vehicle surroundings and detect potentially dangerous situations.   Purpose: to increase safety through advanced situational awareness and   reduce collision possibilities.
	

		 Sensors used in ADAS include cameras, radars, lasers and ultrasound.   They can detect light, heat, pressure and other variables used to   monitor the state of vehicle. Usually they locate in the front and rear   bumpers, side mirrors, vehicle cab and wind shield glasses.

		 ? The preparation measures vary by vehicle and system. Please follow the instructions on the MaxiSys ADAS
	

		 tablet to ensure accurate calibration.
	




What is ADAS Front-view Camera?

		 The front-view camera captures what is in front of the vehicle. It is   used in a number of ADAS systems, including Lane Departure Warning   (LDW), Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) and Traffic Sign/Signal Recognition   (TSR) systems, often in conjunction with other sensors, cameras or   sensing systems to provide input data.
	




What is ADAS 360°Camera?

		 The 360° or Surround View Camera System uses multiple camera views to   create one 360° top-down (birds eye) view surrounding the vehicle.   This system is used in both passive (displayed instructions) and active   (autonomous) vehicle parking assist systems.
	




What is ADAS Radar Sensor?

		 ADAS radar sensors detect fixed and moving objects at different   distances around the perimeter of a vehicle. Different Radar types and   frequencies are used in various ADAS systems. Ultra short-range radar   (USRR) and short-range radar (SRR) provide data for blind-spot detection   (BSD) and lane-change assist (LCA), while systems including adaptive   cruise control (ACC) use longer range radar.
	




How can I get the ADAS software?

		 To get the valuable ADAS calibration software, you can purchase the   MaxiSys ADAS tablet or purchase the ADAS calibration software upgrade   for your existing MaxiSys tablet.
	




What are the technology tools of ADAS and where are they in my vehicle?

		 Cameras, sensors, ultrasound, radar and LIDAR are some of the systems   used to capture the driving environment data, including travelling or   static vehicles position, pedestrian location, road sign, driving lane   and intersection detection, road (curves) and driving conditions (poor   visibility or evening driving), use that information to instruct the   vehicle to take its predetermined action. Cameras, sensors and sensing   systems are typically location in front and rear bumpers, windshield,   front grill and side and rear view mirrors.
	




What if my car is not in a horizontal position?

		 ADAS calibration procedures should be performed on a level floor. If   an alignment lift is used for leveling, the Autel calibration software   can provide adjustment information and the calibration frame can be   easily raised or lowered to be level with the vehicle.
	




Which areas does Autel MaxiSys ADAS support?

		 The MaxiSys ADAS currently supports calibrations for most todays ADAS-enabled vehicles in the USA, Asian, European markets.
	




What are the requirements for the calibration shop?

		 1.Perform calibration procedures indoors without object obstructions
	

		 2.No exterior light sources to cast uneven surface shadows
	

		 3.Some procedures require bright background light alignments
	




What are the requirements for the calibration surface?

		 Park the vehicle on a flat and level surface with its front wheels   pointing straight and ensure there is room around the vehicle (generally   there should not be objects within three meters or ten feet of the   front of the vehicle).

What is ADAS Front-view Camera?

		 The front-view camera captures what is in front of the vehicle. It is   used in a number of ADAS systems, including Lane Departure Warning   (LDW), Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) and Traffic Sign/Signal Recognition   (TSR) systems, often in conjunction with other sensors, cameras or   sensing systems to provide input data.
	




What is ADAS 360°Camera?

		 The 360° or Surround View Camera System uses multiple camera views to   create one 360° top-down (birds eye) view surrounding the vehicle.   This system is used in both passive (displayed instructions) and active   (autonomous) vehicle parking assist systems.
	




What is ADAS Radar Sensor?

		 ADAS radar sensors detect fixed and moving objects at different   distances around the perimeter of a vehicle. Different Radar types and   frequencies are used in various ADAS systems. Ultra short-range radar   (USRR) and short-range radar (SRR) provide data for blind-spot detection   (BSD) and lane-change assist (LCA), while systems including adaptive   cruise control (ACC) use longer range radar.
	




How can I get the ADAS software?

		 To get the valuable ADAS calibration software, you can purchase the   MaxiSys ADAS tablet or purchase the ADAS calibration software upgrade   for your existing MaxiSys tablet.
	




What are the technology tools of ADAS and where are they in my vehicle?

 All fluids must be filled to the recommended levels, e.g. oil, coolant, etc.
The fuel tank must be full
Tire pressure must be set to placard level
No passengers or additional load in the vehicle
All doors and hood must be closed
Connect an auxiliary battery power supply





How do I know if the ADAS recalibration was successful?

		 a. At the end of the calibration procedure the Autel MaxiSYS will   display a screen indicating the calibration completed successfully. It   is a good idea to perform a screenshot at this point and attach this   screen to your post scan report. On some vehicle makes calibration   parameters will be added to the post-SCAN report which indicate the   accuracy of the calibration.

		 The front-view camera captures what is in front of the vehicle. It is   used in a number of ADAS systems, including Lane Departure Warning   (LDW), Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) and Traffic Sign/Signal Recognition   (TSR) systems, often in conjunction with other sensors, cameras or   sensing systems to provide input data.
	




What is ADAS 360°Camera?

		 The 360° or Surround View Camera System uses multiple camera views to   create one 360° top-down (birds eye) view surrounding the vehicle.   This system is used in both passive (displayed instructions) and active   (autonomous) vehicle parking assist systems.
	




What is ADAS Radar Sensor?

		 ADAS radar sensors detect fixed and moving objects at different   distances around the perimeter of a vehicle. Different Radar types and   frequencies are used in various ADAS systems. Ultra short-range radar   (USRR) and short-range radar (SRR) provide data for blind-spot detection   (BSD) and lane-change assist (LCA), while systems including adaptive   cruise control (ACC) use longer range radar.
	




How can I get the ADAS software?

		 To get the valuable ADAS calibration software, you can purchase the   MaxiSys ADAS tablet or purchase the ADAS calibration software upgrade   for your existing MaxiSys tablet.
	




What are the technology tools of ADAS and where are they in my vehicle?

		 Cameras, sensors, ultrasound, radar and LIDAR are some of the systems   used to capture the driving environment data, including travelling or   static vehicles position, pedestrian location, road sign, driving lane   and intersection detection, road (curves) and driving conditions (poor   visibility or evening driving), use that information to instruct the   vehicle to take its predetermined action. Cameras, sensors and sensing   systems are typically location in front and rear bumpers, windshield,   front grill and side and rear view mirrors.
	




What if my car is not in a horizontal position?

		 ADAS calibration procedures should be performed on a level floor. If   an alignment lift is used for leveling, the Autel calibration software   can provide adjustment information and the calibration frame can be   easily raised or lowered to be level with the vehicle.
	




Which areas does Autel MaxiSys ADAS support?

Which vehicle actions require ADAS system diagnostics or ADAS sensor calibration?

		 Sensor Replacement / Accident Repair / Wheel Alignment / Windshield Replacement / Diagnostic Service
	




What is the easiest way to check the vehicle to confirm which ADAS modules are active?

		 During the Pre-SCAN procedure, the MaxiSys software will scan all   modules in all systems and list on a single screen, then provide visual   ADAS icons next to the active ADAS modules. This shows technicians which   ADAS systems are active and helps prepare a more detailed repair plan   which includes the required ADAS calibration procedures after the   repairs are complete.
	




How do I know if the ADAS recalibration was successful?

		 The technician can review the post-calibration scan to confirm if the   module DTC is cleared. The ADAS module calibration will not complete if   the calibration steps were not followed correctly.
	




What are the different types of ADAS calibrations and are they brand specific?

		 Depending on vehicle type, either a Stationary or Dynamic calibration   procedure is required (in some vehicle types both are required) to   calibrate ADAS sensors to vehicle modules.
	

		  Stationary calibrations are completed in a shop environment and requires the use of targets or patterns to complete.
	

		  Dynamic calibrations require the vehicle to be driven on roadways   for a certain amount of time with well maintained road markings.
	




What are the shop environment requirements for calibration procedures?

		  Flat and level surface with enough room around the vehicle to   complete calibration procedures. (generally, there should not be objects   within the 15 foot by 30 foot calibration area)
	

		  Perform calibration procedures indoors without object obstructions.
	

		  No exterior light sources to cast uneven surface shadows.
	

		  Some procedures require bright background light alignments.
	




What vehicle preparation is required before performing calibration procedures?

		  The vehicle coolants and engine oil should be at recommended levels and the gas tank full.
	

		  The vehicle should not be carrying any load (passengers or cargo).
	

		  Adjust the tire pressure to the recommended value.
	

		  Attach the wireless VCI to the vehicle DLC.
	

		  Make sure the MaxiSys is paired to the VCI, then make sure to close all the vehicle doors.
	

		  Establish communication from the diagnostic tool to the vehicle.
	

		  Follow the MaxiSys ADAS software instructions to ensure accurate   calibration. Preparation measures vary by vehicle and system.
	




How do I know what patterns and calibration procedures to use?

		 The Autel MaxiSys ADAS Calibration Application software provides   graphic step-by-step instructions that are vehicle model specific to   confirm the correct patterns are used during the correct calibration   procedures. Your MaxiSys software confirms this information is correct,   based on the vehicle information confirmed from the AutoSCAN feature, to   confirm which active ADAS modules in any vehicle system may need a   calibration procedure completed.
	




Does the MSADAS tablet provide other scan tool functions than ADAS calibration?

		 a. Yes, the MSADAS provides all the same diagnostic and maintence services as the MS908SP, including Pre / Post Scanning
	




Do I need a new scan tool for ADAS calibration, if I already have an existing MS908 / MS908P / MS908S / MS908SP / MS908E?

		 a. You can purchase an ADAS UPGRADE to add ADAS capabilities to your existing Autel MaxiSys scan tool.
	

		 b. If you do not have an Autel scan tool, then you should purchase an MSADAS scan tool package for best value.
	




Can I purchase just the ADAS application upgrade without the calibration frame to complete ADAS calibration procedures?

		 a. No, the MaxiSys ADAS application requires a code (QR code scan) from the calibration frame to activate the software.
	

		 For more information, see 'ADAS Frame Banding' on the DOWNLOAD page.
	




If I want to add individual targets or calibration tools later, are they available for purchase?

		 a. Yes, the specialty fixtures, existing targets and new vehicle coverage targets are available for individual purchase.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS



What is ADAS?
       The Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) uses   image processing cameras, radar, light detection and ranging and other   sensors to monitor vehicle surroundings and detect potentially dangerous   situations. Purpose: to increase safety through advanced situational   awareness and reduce collision possibilities.
       Sensors used in ADAS include cameras, radars, lasers and   ultrasound. They can detect light, heat, pressure and other variables   used to monitor the state of vehicle. Usually they locate in the front   and rear bumpers, side mirrors, vehicle cab and wind shield glasses. 




What are the applications of ADAS?
ADAS usually includes Traffic Message Channel (TMC),   Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA), Vehicular Communication Systems and   other driver assistant systems. The specific systems are as follows:

 Vehicle Cab: 

1) Lane Departure Warning System
2) Lane Keeping Assist
3) Traffic Sign/Signal Recognition
4) Night Vision System
5) Driver Status Monitor
6) Electric Vehicle Warning
7) Hill Descent Control

 Front: 

1) Parking Assist
2) Adaptive Front/Lighting System
3) Adaptive Cruise Control
4) Pedestrian Detection
5) Emergency Brake

1) Reverse Image
2) Parking Assist
3) Rear Collision Warning

 Side: 

1) Surround View
2) Blind Spot Detection




When to use ADAS?
Under normal circumstances, after repair in an accident,   calibration of the relevant auxiliary systems need to be performed. When   disassembling or reinstalling monitoring components such as cameras,   radars, and sensors, replacing the vehicle ECU, or the vehicle height   has been changed, auxiliary and other systems need to be calibrated.
For example: ACC calibration needs to be performed in the following cases.
1. Repair or replace the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) radar sensor control unit
2. ACC radar sensor deviation angle out of normal range
3. Adjust position of the ACC radar sensor on the vehicle body
4. Repair or replace bumper or radiator grill
5. Adjust chassis




How to use MaxiSys ADAS?
Perform the following steps prior to setting-up calibration toolset.
① Park the vehicle on a flat and level surface with its front wheels pointing straight and ensure there are no objects
    in front of the vehicle.
② The vehicles coolants and engine oil should be at recommended levels and the gas tank full. The vehicle should
    not be carrying any load (passengers or cargo).
③ Attach the VCI to the vehicle and connect the diagnostic tool to the vehicle (if connected through cable, please
    pass cable through window).
④ Close the vehicle doors.
⑤ Adjust the tire pressure to the recommended value.
⑥ The preparation measures vary by vehicle and system. Please follow the instructions on the MaxiSys ADAS
    tablet to ensure accurate calibration.




What is ADAS Front-view Camera？
The front-view camera   captures what is in front of the vehicle. It is used in a number of ADAS   systems, including Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Lane Keeping Assist   (LKA) and Traffic Sign/Signal Recognition (TSR) systems, often in   conjunction with other sensors, cameras or sensing systems to provide   input data.




What is ADAS 360°Camera？
      The 360° or Surround   View Camera System uses multiple camera views to create one 360°   top-down (birds eye) view surrounding the vehicle. This system is used   in both passive (displayed instructions) and active (autonomous) vehicle   parking assist systems.




What is ADAS Radar Sensor？
      ADAS radar sensors   detect fixed and moving objects at different distances around the   perimeter of a vehicle. Different Radar types and frequencies are used   in various ADAS systems. Ultra short-range radar (USRR) and short-range   radar (SRR) provide data for blind-spot detection (BSD) and lane-change   assist (LCA), while systems including adaptive cruise control (ACC) use   longer range radar.




How can I get the ADAS software?
To get the valuable ADAS   calibration software, you can purchase the MaxiSys ADAS tablet or   purchase the ADAS calibration software upgrade for your existing MaxiSys   tablet.




What are the technology tools of ADAS and where are they in my vehicle?
      Cameras, sensors, ultrasound, radar and LIDAR are   some of the systems used to capture the driving environment data,   including travelling or static vehicles position, pedestrian location,   road sign, driving lane and intersection detection, road (curves) and   driving conditions (poor visibility or evening driving), use that   information to instruct the vehicle to take its predetermined action.   Cameras, sensors and sensing systems are typically location in front and   rear bumpers, windshield, front grill and side and rear view mirrors.




What if my car is not in a horizontal position?
ADAS calibration procedures   should be performed on a level floor. If an alignment lift is used for   leveling, the Autel calibration software can provide adjustment   information and the calibration frame can be easily raised or lowered to   be level with the vehicle.

Launch Tech USA X-431 ADAS










HERE'S WHAT INCLUDED WITH STANDARD PACKAGE

X-431 ADAS Calibration Frame 
2x Wheel Clamps, Calibration Panel, Radar Reflector 
Scan Tool NOT Included





DESCRIPTION

			ADAS stand for Advanced Driver Assist   Systems- These systems are designed to create a safer environment for   the driver and those around him. These systems help reduce the   possibility of an accident or collision. They have been around since the   late 1990s but used in the early to mid 2000s in the US with the use   of Adaptive Cruise Control or ACC. These vehicles made use of LiDAR   distance detection but only offered a warning to the driver. Those   systems would be classified as a passive system. Todays systems are more   advanced and integrated. They use multiple sensor inputs such as   cameras and radar to assist and warn the driver of surrounding danger.
		




PRODUCT FEATURES

The modular structure and useful accessories enable you to configure the tool in the best way to suit your workshop.
Easily and precisely adjust calibration frame to ensure vehicle is correctly centered.
Can be used even without an axial measuring system.
Multiple calibration function, wide car model coverage.
All kinds of vehicle-specific calibration panels are available.
Provide the instruction before beginning a calibration procedure.





X-431 ADAS Product Components









TYPES OF CALIBRATIONS
Dynamic vs static calibration- There are two types of recalibration that are performed for ADAS. 

Static calibration  is a   calibration that is performed in a controlled environment (Indoor shop   with good lighting, level ground, and required space) with special   targets placed in specific locations in front and around the vehicle.   Also a scanner is required to communicate with the modules of that   vehicle.
		









Dynamic calibration  also referred to   as mobile calibration, is performed by driving your car for a   prescribed distance, at a prescribed speed and in optimum weather   conditions. A handheld device (scanner) that aids the process is   attached to the car during the test. The purpose of this type of   calibration is for the systems to get accustomed to the road so that   they can be ready for all the functions theyre expected to perform.
		****X-431 Throttle Not Included






 





CREATE CHANGE

          The increase in complexity has brought   about a challenge in the auto industry. You can no longer perform basic   procedures or replace components and not worry about it affecting these   driver assist systems. And if you happen to unplug or replace a   component that is attached to these systems you will find that it will   require a recalibration to clear a warning or check engine light. You   cant just clear the code. Here is a list of the most common procedure   that require a recalibration:
          

Windshield Replacement
Alignment
Front and rear bumper replacement
Side view mirrors
Rear trunk or tailgate
Front or rear collision














CALIBRATE SENSORS


Adaptive Cruise Control
Lane Depature Warning
Autonous Emergency Breaking 
Front Collision Warning
Pedestrain Collision Warning
Traffic Sign Recognition
Night Vision
Around View Monitoring
Blind Spot Detection
Parking Assistance
Rear Collision Warning
